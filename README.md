Kratos is written in C++, and counts with an extensive Python interface. More in [Overview](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Overview)

Kratos is __multiplatform__ and available for __Windows, Linux__ (several distros) and __macOS__, for  __OpenMP__ and __MPI__ parallelization.

Kratos is free under BSD-4 [license](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Licence) and can be used even in comercial softwares as it is. Many of its main applications are also free and BSD-4 licensed but each derived application can have its own propietary license.
